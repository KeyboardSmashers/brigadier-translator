# Brigadier Translator
### New Minecraft command syntax translation made easy

Besides new fancy aquatic and subaquatic features, 1.13 brings **a new command syntax** which makes it more intuitive to write commands, but breaks many custom maps.

This tool translates pre-1.13 commands into 1.13 ones and keeps them working.

## How to use
### Automatic translation
Choose a Minecraft world to open. Brigadier Translator will automatically convert every command block to use 1.13 command syntax. Note that this is still being considered.
### Manual translation
Type in a pre-1.13 command to translate, and click **Translate**. The tool will convert the command to 1.13 syntax.
